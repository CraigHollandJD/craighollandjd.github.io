    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>
      I work at the intersection of law, artificial intelligence, and human understanding.
      My focus is not acceleration or spectacle, but clarity—how complex systems behave,
      how people learn them, and how technology can assist without overwhelming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Practically, this includes AI evaluation and training work, applied research,
      and teaching-oriented explanations for non-technical professionals.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am formally trained as a lawyer (Juris Doctor), with years of experience
      operating inside regulated, high-stakes environments.
      That background shaped how I think: precision matters, language matters,
      and systems tend to fail at their edges.
    </p>
    <p>
      In recent years, my work has shifted toward artificial intelligence—particularly
      how models are trained, evaluated, and interpreted by humans.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>How I Think</h2>
    <p>
      I tend to take the long road. I work from first principles, look for quiet failure modes,
      and resist simple narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’m comfortable holding uncertainty while structure emerges.
      I value grounded reasoning over speed, and insight over volume.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Current Directions</h2>
    <p>
      Lately, my attention has been focused on:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>AI systems as learning partners rather than replacements</li>
      <li>Training data quality, annotation integrity, and evaluation rigor</li>
      <li>Teaching AI concepts to non-technical professionals</li>
      <li>Voice, audio, and human-centered interfaces</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <h2>Protaizoa</h2>
    <p>
      Protaizoa is a conceptual project and a quiet workspace—an attempt to think about
      intelligence at the smallest useful unit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It exists in the background, informing how I approach larger systems.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Contact & Presence</h2>
    <p>
      I don’t optimize for visibility, but I do value thoughtful conversation.
